# cypress-and-percy-course

Repository for the basic course of visual regression testing with Cypress and Percy, by Walmyr Filho.

## Pre-requirements

To install the project dependencies and run the automated tests, you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](http://npmjs.com) installed on your computer.

> The following versions of the above-mentioned packages were used during the development of this project (`node v14.15.0` and `npm 6.14.8`.)

> Installing Node.js automatically installs NPM so you don't need to do it yourself.

## Installation

After cloning the project, access its directory (`cd cypress-and-percy-course`) and run `npm install` to install the dev dependencies.

## Exporting the project token created on Percy.io

As an environment variable, export the token of your project (you can find it on Percy's dashboard). See the below examples for exporting the token for both Windows and Unix (Mac and Linux) operating systems.

```
# Windows
$ set PERCY_TOKEN=<your token here>

# Unix
$ export PERCY_TOKEN=<your token here>
```

## Running the tests

Run `npm test` to execute the tests in headless mode.
